<p>My thesis was about designing a steering actuator for our driverless electric race car at BME Formula Racing Team. To achieve this, I went with the traditional waterfall method as it fit into the approach we have followed on vehicle level. This included the following actions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Collecting requirements (regulations and team needs)</li>
	<li>Benchmarking and literature research</li>
	<li>Conceptual design creation</li>
	<li>Calculations to validate the concept</li>
	<li>Pre-design, choosing off-the-shelf products</li>
	<li>Structural design creation</li>
	<li>Manufacturing and ordering products</li>
	<li>Assembling and testing</li>
	<li>Suggestions for improvement, summary</li>
</ul>
<p>Please forgive me that they are written only in Hungarian.</p>
